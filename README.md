The library allows in the simplest way to add "Route to `any location`" functionality to your app. By calling the only one method the library attempt to present an ActionSheet with all supported and installed navigation app on the device.

For now, supporting: Apple Maps, Google Maps, Waze and Yandex.


## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.


## Installation

MapLauncher is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'MapLauncher'
```

## Usage 

Add to your project `Info.plist` next key-value pair:

```
...
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
	<array>
		<string>waze</string>
		<string>comgooglemaps</string>
		<string>yandexnavi</string>
		<string>mapsme</string>
	</array>
...
```

In a place where you are going to implement the functionality you need to import the library:

`import MapLauncher`


And call ActionSheet next way:

```
...
// Desired destination coordinates
let placeLocation = CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 50.4536, longitude: 30.5164)

// Presenting navigation apps ActionSheet
MapLauncher().present(destination: placeLocation, on: self)
...
```
